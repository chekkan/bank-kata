## Bank Kata (Object Calisthenics)
Create a simple bank application with the following features:

- Deposit into Account
- Withdraw from an Account
- Transfer money from one account to another
- Print a bank statement to the console.
- Statement should have the following the format:
```
	DATE        AMOUNT   BALANCE
	01/04/2014  1000.00  1000.00
	02/04/2014  -100.00   900.00
	10/04/2014   500.00  1400.00
```

### Part 2
- Filter statement by deposits
- Filter statement by withdrawals
- Filter statement by date range

### Constraints (Object Calisthenics)
1. One level of indentation per method (1)
2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword (2)
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings (1)
4. First class collections (1)
5. One dot per line (1)
6. Don’t abbreviate (1)
7. Keep all entities small (50 lines) (0)
8. No classes with more than two instance variables (2)
9. No getters/setters/properties (2)

Legend:

 * (0) Always required
 * (1) Good enough for OOP
 * (2) Will stretch the learners. Better with an advanced class
